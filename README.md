## Team Members

## Abstract
The last few decades have witnessed rapid advances in automation technology amidst growing anxiety about the labor market. As emerging technologies mature and gain commercial traction, concerns of jobs displacement will only heighten. We present a data article, driven by associated interactive visualizations, that explores the underlying demographic dynamics of automation displacement. In accordance with prior work, we place automation-related labor displacement into three categories – AI, robotics, and software, and explore the relationship between these factors and various geographic and educational factors. In particular, we highlight a surprising finding that while AI-related labor displacement disproportionately impacts highly-educated populations.

##  Commentary on research/development process
Our research and development process included the following steps: (1) Literature review on the impact of technology on US labor markets, (2) researching and pre-porcessing datasets (merging, coding of variables, agreggation and weighting), (3) exploratory data analysis, (4) iterative development of individual charts, (5) scrollytelling. 

## Division of Work
* Bhavik took the lead on the line chart of historic trends, the tile grid map, the scrollytelling, and the aesthetics of the website.
* Lucas took the lead on data pre-processing, the ridgeline plot, the treemap (included in milestone review but not in the final product), and the text for scrollytelling.
