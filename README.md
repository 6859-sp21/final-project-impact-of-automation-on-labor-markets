##  Commentary on research/development process
Our research and development process included the following steps: (1) Literature review on the impact of technology on US labor markets, (2) researching and pre-porcessing datasets (merging, coding of variables, agreggation and weighting), (3) exploratory data analysis, (4) iterative development of individual charts, (5) scrollytelling. 

## Division of Work
* Bhavik took the lead on the line chart of historic trends, the tile grid map, the scrollytelling, and the aesthetics of the website.
* Lucas took the lead on data pre-processing, the ridgeline plot, the treemap (included in milestone review but not in the final product), and the text for scrollytelling.
