        <h1>Who's Susceptible To The Automation Boom?</h1>
        <h4>By Lucas Kitzmueller & Bhavik Nagda | May, 2021</h4>
        <h3>The last few decades have witnessed rapid advances in automation technology amidst growing anxiety about
            the
            labor market. As emerging technologies mature and gain commercial traction, concerns of jobs
            displacement
            will
            only heighten. New technologies create winners and losers. They improve employment opportunities for
            some
            workers but lower the demand for others. Scroll down to learn more about the impacts of automation on
            certain
            economies, geographies, and demographics.

        In the last 30 years, it was primarily workers in middle-skilled occupations in production and
        administration
        who found themselves on the wrong side of the demand curve. These jobs have in common that they require
        challenging, yet at the end of the day, repetitive routine tasks that can be automated.
    </section>
    <section class="linechart story" id="linechart-step3">
        For example, industrial robots reduced the need for factory workers and computers have reduced the
        demand
        for
        secretaries.
    </section>
    <section class="linechart story" id="linechart-step4">
        While employment in middle-skill occupations was declining, high-skill occupations such as managers and
        professionals were growing . These occupations rely on cognitive non-routine
        tasks,
        which
        to date have been proven hard to automate.
    </section>
    <section class="linechart story" id="linechart-step5">
        Similarly, low-skill occupations with a large share of manual routine tasks <a
            href="https://workofthefuture.mit.edu/research-post/the-work-of-the-future-shaping-technology-and-institutions/">have
            been growing. </a> This includes,
        for example, workers in personal care services.

        <h2>The Data</h2>
        <br>
        However, as the commercial adoption of AI is still nascent in many industries, it is still unclear what
        workers
        will be
        affected by AI. While there exist many studies on the labor market impact of robot adoption, there are
        no
        comparable
        studies for AI technologies.

        Fortunately, the Stanford economist Michael Webb has <a href="https://www.michaelwebb.co/webb_ai.pdf"> developed
            a clever way </a> to measure future exposure
        to AI
        technologies. His idea is the following: The text of AI-based patents contains information about what
        technologies do,
        and the text of job descriptions compiled by the Department of Labor contains information about the
        tasks
        people
        do in
        their jobs. Combining these two datasets, we can quantify what jobs AI may soon be capable of performing
        at
        the
        workplace.

        For example, one of the tasks of doctors is “Interpret tests to diagnose patient’s condition”. From
        these
        task
        descriptions, Webb extracts verb-object pairs. In this case, the pairs would be (interpret, test) and
        (diagnose,
        condition). To then measure this task’s exposure to AI, Webb calculates the frequency of these
        verb-object
        pairs
        in the
        titles of all AI-based patents. With this method, he is able to rank 964 occupations in the database
        according
        to their
        exposure to AI technology. To contrast the impact of AI with past technological shocks, Webb also
        calculates
        the
        exposure to robots and software technologies.

        For this analysis, we grouped occupations by their typical entry level education as determined by the
        Bureau
        of
        Labor
        Statistics. The graph shows distribution of Webb’s exposure estimates within each educational group.
        Occupations
        are
        weighted by size (i.e., the number of workers employed in the occupation in 2019).

        The data for robot exposure confirm the earlier finding: less-educated workers, typically employed in
        jobs
        with
        a high
        share of manual routine tasks, are more exposed to disruption from robotics than higher-educated
        workers.
    </section>
    <section class="ridgeline story" id="ridgeline-step4">
        The exposure estimates for AI, however, reveal an opposite pattern. Some lower-skill occupations, such
        as
        power
        plant
        operators and dispatchers, are still highly exposed. But many highly educated workers will be impacted
        too,
        such
        as
        clinical laboratory technicians, chemical engineers, and optometrists. In fact, workers with a
        bachelor’s
        degree
        appear
        to be exposed the most.

        Worker displacement represents a challenge for policymakers, especially if it is concentrated in few
        labor
        markets. The
        map shows the exposure of states to different technologies, based on the occupational composition of
        their
        workforce as
        calculated from the <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps.html">Current Population Survey.</a>
    </section>
    <section class="map story" id="map-step3">
        As expected, states involved in manufacturing, such as Wisconsin or Kentucky, are heavily impacted by
        robotics.
    </section>
    <section class="map story" id="map-step4">
        However, as AI is increasingly linked to production, the states involved in manufacturing appear to be
        also
        disproportionately exposed to AI. At the same time, states with a large high-tech sector and managerial
        workforce, e.g.,
        Washington DC, Boston, and Washington state, also have high exposure to AI technologies.

    <section class="map story" id="map-step5">
        These findings suggest that this time will be different: while past automation shocks primarily affected
        lower
        and
        middle-skilled workers, AI is set to displace higher-skilled workers. And while increases in robots
        primarily
        impact
        regions intensive in manufacturing, the impact of AI will be felt more widely across the US.
